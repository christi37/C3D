# C3D Language

Welcome to **C3D**, a minimalist programming language designed specifically for 3D game engine development using OpenGL 3.3. C3D combines simple, readable syntax inspired by C++ and Python with the full power of native C++ interoperability, making it easier than ever to create complex 3D applications and engines.

## Features

- Modular system (or extensions): Use `add moduleName;` to quickly, easily add for example opengl330; or opengl3.3; faster and easier! check Extensions to see the current available extensions/modules


## Getting Started

1. Download one of the releases
2. Extract the folder, and launch the compiler.
3. Compile the demo.c3d
4. Launch the Demo.exe and see the demo
5. Enjoy and wait for updates


## Roadmap

- Version 1.0: Currently being worked on
