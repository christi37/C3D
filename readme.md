# C3D Language

Welcome to **C3D**, a minimalist programming language designed specifically for 3D game engine development using OpenGL 3.3. C3D combines simple, readable syntax inspired by C++ and Python with the full power of native C++ interoperability, making it easier than ever to create complex 3D applications and engines.

## Features

- Modular system (or extensions): Use `add moduleName;` to quickly, easily add for example opengl330; or opengl3.3; faster and easier! check Extensions to see the current available extensions/modules


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the included documentation to set up your build environment.
3. Write your C3D programs using simple syntax and modules.
4. Use the transpiler to convert C3D code into C++.
5. Compile the generated C++ with your preferred toolchain. (tested on g++)

## Roadmap

- Version 1.0: Currently being worked on

## License

C3D is distributed under a **custom license** that permits usage, modification, and redistribution of compiled outputs and programs created with C3D. The original source code of C3D and any modified versions of it **cannot be redistributed** without explicit permission.
